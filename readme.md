# `VST.NET` 2 (Beta)

---
## New Version: `VST.NET` 2!

`VST.NET` 2 builds on the basis of `VST.NET` (1) and is completely built with .NET Core 3.1. The new version is still Windows-only and supports the Steinberg VST 2.x API.

This means that `VST.NET` (1) is phasing out and will not receive any more updates. If you are looking for the old `VST.NET` (1) code, its in the branch called `vstnet1`. Of course you can still ask questions about `VST.NET` (1), but no feature requests or bug fixes will be applied.

## What is `VST.NET`

`VST.NET` allows VST Plugin developers to write Plugins in any .NET language. The interop layer makes the transition between the C++ and .NET world smooth and easy.
The Framework built on top of the interop layer provides a clear and structured architecture accelerating development considerably.

`VST.NET` also allows developers to write a managed VST2 Host application. The VstPluginContext class (Interop.Host) allows you to load and communicate with unmanaged (and managed) VST Plugins. At this time there is no Framework for Host applications.
