* Turn on Managed Debug Assistants (MDA) in VS (Exceptions dialog).

* Make sure your build platform for the Plugin assembly is explicit (x86/x64). AnyCPU is not supported.
* Use DllExport to export the GetPluginFactory export method that is called by the host. Retrieve through NuGet "Unmanaged Exports".

* First interface in class implementation is default COM interface. Make sure the order is correct: class MyFactory : IPluginFactory, IPluginFactory2, IPluginFactory3 {}.
	- This does not seem to matter much
* Apply the ClassInterface(ClassInterface.None) attribute to your implementation code. This makes sure no class members are exposed to COM.
	- probably only really needed when doing genuine COM interop.
* Structures in .NET can not be inherited. You have to repeat the member of the 'base class' in the new struct definition. These must match exactly.
* Interfaces for COM exposure cannot be inherited (even when the COM representation is). Also repeat all inherited members (top-base intf) and do not derive from interface.

Decissions:
* Chose to PreserveSig to give more control on what TResults are returned. Also reflects C++ VST 3 interface exactly. 
* No docs: use the original C++ VST 3 documentation. (will copy code comments from SDK and create for support classes).
* Method return value is Int32 in stead of TResult for performance. TResult does provide constants to return.
